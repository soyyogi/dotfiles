I've been looking for a better way to manage my dotfiles.  

Using git bare repositories, Now, I just add, commit and then push.  Done.

Want to make your own git bare repository?  
First, make a directory for your new git bare repository 
(I created one called "dotfiles" but you can name it whatever).

Then I entered the following in the terminal:

git init --bare $HOME/dotfiles
alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME' (add this alias to .bashrc)
bash
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

Basic usage example:

config add /path/to/file
config commit -m "A short message"
config push

WHAT'S THE REASON FOR THE GIT BARE REPO?

By using the git bare repo, you can have nested git repos in your home directory 
and there will not be any issue with keeping things straight.   
That is the reason for the git bare repo and having an alias ("config").
